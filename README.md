Week 1

Discuss through online meetings with teachers. I officially identified the Dream Core phenomenon as the theme of my graduation project game. Due to this phenomenon appearing in human virtual dreams, I was unable to find specific images as favorable materials, so I began conducting extensive research on various details of Dream Core. From the reasons for the occurrence, the various colors of the Dream Core, the different visual stages created by the Dream Core in a dream, what elements are included in the scene that appears, how people who have also experienced the Dream Core describe and evaluate their feelings when the Dream Core occurs, and so on, and compare and associate it with the scene memory of my own multiple personal experiences. After synthesis, record the similarities and differences of the Dream Core phenomenon in different people's memories. This can ensure that the dream core phenomenon is better restored in game design without causing style deviation.
