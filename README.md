Week 1

Discuss through online meetings with teachers. I officially identified the Dream Core phenomenon as the theme of my graduation project game. Due to this phenomenon appearing in human virtual dreams, I was unable to find specific images as favorable materials, so I began conducting extensive research on various details of Dream Core. From the reasons for the occurrence, the various colors of the Dream Core, the different visual stages created by the Dream Core in a dream, what elements are included in the scene that appears, how people who have also experienced the Dream Core describe and evaluate their feelings when the Dream Core occurs, and so on, and compare and associate it with the scene memory of my own multiple personal experiences. After synthesis, record the similarities and differences of the Dream Core phenomenon in different people's memories. This can ensure that the dream core phenomenon is better restored in game design without causing style deviation.


Week 2

This week, based on the main visual style features of Dream Core collected, I searched online for many real-life photos and scenes similar to Dream Core phenomenon that people accidentally captured, including water amusement parks, abandoned kindergartens, an endless dark tunnel, messy and empty rooms, and so on. Some of the photos showed elements that were even like those in my dream, which shocked me, Because of this feeling, I have had similar events in real life before. During my college years, I went to an old shopping mall to buy materials. When I took the escalator to the top floor, I suddenly felt a sense of time and space confusion because this scene was my first time here and I had never been there before. However, I felt so familiar and friendly. At that time, I only thought it was an illusion or a lack of sleep, but now I understand that this is the same principle as Dream Core, It is all caused by the subconscious brain's disorder of memory time and space. In summary, the main characteristic of Dream Core is its surrealistic style, which reveals dreaminess, unreality, and nostalgia (feeling that this scene appears in childhood memories, but has not been personally experienced). All Dream Core phenomena are relatively quiet in space, giving people a sense of suffocation, which is also one of the biggest characteristics of Dream Core phenomena. The reason for the above situation is actually related to the experiences and memories in the brain, and through the repeated organization and presentation of dreams, the phenomenon of Dream Core that seem familiar has emerged. I also added the characteristics and specific content summarized in this research section to the preliminary research section of the paper.
